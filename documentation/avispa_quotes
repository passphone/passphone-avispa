Automated Security Protocol Analysis With the AVISPA Tool, Luca Vigan√≤
"The AVISPA Tool is a push-button tool for the Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications which rises to this challenge in a systematic way by
i)  providing a modular and expressive formal language for specifying security protocols nd properties, the High-Level Protocol Language HLPSL, and
ii) integrating different back-ends that implement variety of automatic analysis techniques ranging from protocol falsification (by finding an attack on the input protocol) to abstraction-based verification methods for infinite numbers of sessions"

The AVISPA Tool for the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications, .....
AVISPA is a push-button tool for the automated validation of Internet security-sensitive protocols and applications. It provides a modular and expressive formal language for specifying protocols and their security properties, and integrates different back-ends that implement a variety of state-of-the-art automatic analysis techniques. To the best of our knowledge, no other tool exhibits the same level of scope and robustness while enjoying the same performance and scalability
